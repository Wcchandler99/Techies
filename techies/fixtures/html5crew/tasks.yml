html5_game_coding:
  <<: *task_common
  agent: html5_game_architect
  description: >
    Objective: Create a fully functional HTML5 game based on the provided game_hierarchy.xml and game_desc files.

    1. Understand Game Requirements:
        - Read the Files:
            - Read the game_hierarchy.xml file to understand the overall game structure, components, and their relationships.
            - Read the game_desc file to understand the game specifications, mechanics, and detailed requirements.
        - Clarify Any Ambiguities:
            - If any part of the game design or requirements is unclear, consult with relevant agents or request additional information.

    2. Game Development Tasks:
        - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Code:
            - Write clean, modular, and maintainable HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript code that adheres to the game specifications and hierarchy described in the files.
            - Ensure the code is well-documented and follows best practices for web development.
        - Delegation of Tasks:
            - Assign Specific Tasks:
                - Identify specific game components or sections (e.g., player controls, game logic, UI elements).
                - Delegate these tasks to agents with relevant expertise. For example, assign UI tasks to a UI designer agent and game logic to a JavaScript developer agent.
                - For tasks that do not fit any specialized agents, assign them to the html5_game_engineer agent.
            - Communication and Collaboration:
                - Ensure all agents are aware of each other's work and consistently reference existing components to maintain code consistency and integration.
                - If a necessary component is missing, either create it or delegate its creation to the appropriate agent.
        - File Management:
            - Every time an agent completes a task, they must save their work to an appropriately named file (e.g., playerControls.js, gameUI.html).
            - Agents should provide brief documentation or comments within the code to explain their functionality and how it integrates with the rest of the game.

    3. Output Requirements:
        - Final Deliverables:
            - Compile all the developed game components into cohesive HTML files for each part of the game.
            - Ensure that the final output is a complete and playable game as specified in the game layout and specifications.
        - Quality Assurance:
            - Test the game thoroughly to ensure all components work together seamlessly and the game is playable without any errors.
            - Perform a review to ensure the code meets the game specifications and is free of bugs.

    Key Points for Agents:
      - Focus on collaborative development to ensure seamless integration of game components.
      - Follow a modular approach to development, making the codebase easy to maintain and expand.
      - Ensure the game is optimized for performance and compatible across different browsers.
      - Prioritize usability and user experience based on the game specifications.

    Instructions for Agents:

        1. Understanding the Current State of the Game:
            - Game Hierarchy and Specifications: Read and thoroughly understand the game hierarchy from game_hierarchy.xml and the game specifications from game_desc. Ensure that you are familiar with the entire structure, mechanics, and intended functionalities of the game.
            - Review Test Results: Analyze the contents of test_results.txt to identify any bugs, performance issues, or incomplete functionalities. Pay attention to failed tests, edge cases, and areas needing improvement.

        2. Code Improvement and Assignment of Tasks:
            - Analyze Test Failures: Identify the specific parts of the game code that need to be improved based on the test results. Prioritize fixing critical issues, addressing broken functionality, and ensuring that edge cases are properly handled.
            - Delegate to Agents: Assign specific coding tasks to the most appropriate agents based on their expertise. Ensure that each agent is working on a distinct part of the game to maximize efficiency and avoid overlapping efforts:
                - Delegate gameplay logic to agents skilled in handling mechanics.
                - Assign user interface and animation improvements to agents specializing in design and interaction.
                - For general coding and coordination tasks, assign them to the html5_game_engineer agent.
            - Refer to Existing Components: Ensure that agents consistently reference existing components in the code. Agents should reuse or adapt these components when possible. If a necessary component does not already exist, either create it directly or delegate the task to an agent best suited for the task.

        3. Code Integration and Collaboration:
            - Collaborative Development: Agents must be aware of their coworkers' work to ensure smooth integration of the code. Communicate and collaborate where necessary to avoid conflicts or duplication of code.
            - Code Overwriting: Agents should overwrite their assigned sections of the code with new, improved versions. Ensure that all bugs, broken functionality, and edge cases identified in the test results are addressed in the updated code.
            - Component Creation: If a new component is needed that doesn't currently exist in the code, the responsible agent should create it. If the task requires specialized knowledge, delegate the creation of the component to the appropriate agent.

        4. Final Output:
            - Single HTML5 File: Once all code improvements have been implemented, consolidate the entire game code into a single HTML5 file. This file should contain all scripts, styles, assets, and functionalities required to run the game seamlessly.
