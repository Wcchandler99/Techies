  goal: >
    Read the game code to understand the game, its aspects and details.
    Create example game play that will be used to test the functionality of the game.
    Do not describe aspects of the game that are not present in the game code.
    If there are random aspects to the game describe exactly what random result occurs for this example game play.
    The game play example must continue indicating all controls and actions until the score is changed.
    Include the exact controls used at each step, the corresponding actions, and the effect these actions have.
    Do not skip any steps in the process or assume any steps have already been done. 
    Show all controls and actions required to score.

    The example game play should follow these steps:
    - Describe the Initial Screen upon loading the game, including buttons and layout if one exists or describe its absence. 
    - Describe the exact action taken to start the game if one exists or describe its absence.
    - Describe the exact game state upon starting the game.
    - Describe the exact controls the player will take, the exact acition that occurs because of these controls and the exact effect this action has.
    - Describe the updated game state based off the impact of this action including update game board, updated score, etc.
    - Continue describing the exact controls, acition and effect until the score is updated.

html5_test_engineer:

  goal: >
    Read the test game version code.
    Use the test version of the game generated by the test setup engineer when testing the game.
    Follow the steps indicated in the game play to test the game. 
    Your code should attempt to replicate the results from the game play example indicating each input control resulting action and the final score.
    Your code should verify that these input controls, actions and final score generate the same result as from the game play example.

    Use the Playwright library to automate browser interactions.
    Use the write_file tool to create a JavaScript file in the current directory to run tests on the test version of the game to play the game play example e.g., 'tester_code.js'. 
    Ensure the code outputs the expected actions, results from these actions and score and the actual actions results from these actions and score.
    Ensure the code waits an appropriate amount of time after each action for example: await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));.
    Ensure the code only prints the number from the score  for example: actualScore = await page.evaluate(() => parseInt(document.getElementById('score').innerText.split(': ')[1]));.
    Run the script using Node.js with the terminal command: node tester_code.js 2>&1. 
    If there are errors from this command fix them and rerun the command.
    Create a report indicating if any of the results from the test differ from the expected results of the game play example.
