    Objective: Create a detailed and specific gameplay example that will be used to test the functionality of the HTML5 game. The example should thoroughly document each step, control, action, and resulting game state until the score is updated.

        Understand the Game:
            Review Game Code: Begin by reading the game code to gain a complete understanding of the game's mechanics, features, and details. Ensure you know all aspects of the game that need to be tested.

        Create Example Gameplay:
            Design Testing Scenarios: Design test scenarios that include the initialization of dynamic game elements, the attachment of event listeners, and the handling of user interactions. Ensure these tests simulate real gameplay conditions to catch any issues with element visibility, interaction, and UI updates.

        Detailing the Gameplay Example:
            Initial Screen Description: Describe the initial screen upon loading the game, including the layout, buttons, and any other UI elements. If an initial screen does not exist, clearly state its absence.
            Starting the Game: Detail the exact action required to start the game, such as pressing a "Start" button or performing an initial action. If no specific action is required to start the game, note this absence.
            Game State at Start: Describe the exact state of the game when it begins, including the position of game elements, initial score, and any other relevant details.
            Controls, Actions, and Effects: Document every step the player will take, including:
                The exact controls used (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks, or touch inputs).
                The specific action that results from these controls (e.g., moving a character, firing a projectile).
                The effect of this action on the game state (e.g., character movement, updated score).
            Game State Update: After each action, describe the updated game state, including changes to the game board, score, and any other relevant elements.
            Random Elements: If the game includes random elements, specify the exact outcome of these elements for the purposes of this example. Avoid ambiguity by clearly defining the result of any randomness in the gameplay.

        Comprehensive Documentation:
            Thorough Documentation: Do not skip any steps in the process. Ensure that each action is documented with the corresponding control, action, and effect.
            Continuous Testing: The example gameplay should continue in detail until the score is updated, demonstrating how the game processes player input and updates the game state.

    Key Deliverables:

        Detailed Gameplay Example: Provide a thorough gameplay example that covers all interactions from the initial screen to the first score update.
        Test Scenarios Documentation: Ensure the testing scenarios are well-documented, including all controls, actions, and effects, ensuring no steps are assumed or omitted.

  goal: >
    Objective: Create a new instance of the game where the random events match the predefined outcomes specified in the gameplay example, without altering any other aspects of the game.

        Understand the Game and Gameplay Example:
            Begin by reading the game code to understand how random events are currently generated and integrated into the game.
            Review the gameplay example file thoroughly, paying special attention to where and how random results are predefined in the example scenario.

        Replace Randomization with Predefined Results:
            Modify the game code to replace any random event generation with the specific, predefined outcomes outlined in the gameplay example. Ensure these changes only affect the random events and maintain the consistency of the game as described in the example.
            Ensure that only the random aspects of the game are affected by this change and that the rest of the game remains untouched.

        Create a New Instance:
            Save the modified game as a new instance without overwriting the original game file. This new instance should behave identically to the original, with the exception that all random events now produce the exact results as described in the gameplay example.

        Code Quality:
            Write clean, efficient, and production-ready HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS code. Ensure that the code is perfectly functional without any placeholders or "TODO" comments.
            Double-check that the new instance of the game works correctly with the predefined random outcomes and that no other aspects of the game have been changed.

    Key Deliverables:

        A new instance of the game that follows the predefined outcomes for random events as described in the gameplay example.
        Clean and perfect HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS code that only modifies randomization behavior without affecting other game components.
        The original game file remains intact and unmodified.

html5_test_engineer:
  <<: *common_attributes_no_deleg
  goal: >
    Objective: Generate and run unit tests on the test version of the HTML5 game to ensure that the gameplay outcomes match the predefined results from the gameplay example. Provide feedback based on the test results.

        Understand the Test Version of the Game:
            Start by reading the code of the test version of the game provided by the Test Setup Engineer. This version includes predefined outcomes for random events based on the gameplay example.

        Test Gameplay Replication:
            Follow the steps detailed in the gameplay example to test the game. Your testing should replicate the exact input controls, resulting actions, and final score as described.
            Verify that each input control, resulting action, and final score produced during the test matches the expected results from the gameplay example.

        Automate Testing with Playwright:
            Use the Playwright library to automate the browser interactions needed to play through the test version of the game. Your script should:
                Replicate each step in the gameplay example, including all controls and actions.
                Wait an appropriate amount of time after each action to ensure accurate testing (e.g., await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));).
                Extract and compare the final score to ensure it matches the expected outcome (e.g., actualScore = await page.evaluate(() => parseInt(document.getElementById('score').innerText.split(': ')[1]));).

        Write and Run the Test Script:
            Use the write_file tool to create a JavaScript file (tester_code.js) in the current directory that automates the testing process using Playwright.
            Ensure that the script outputs the expected actions, results from these actions, and final score, alongside the actual results observed during the test.
            Run the script using Node.js with the command: node tester_code.js 2>&1. If errors occur, fix them and rerun the command until the test runs successfully.

        Generate a Test Report:
            After running the tests, create a report that highlights any discrepancies between the actual test results and the expected outcomes from the gameplay example.
            The report should clearly indicate whether the game passed the test and detail any differences in controls, actions, or final score.

    Key Deliverables:

        A Playwright script (tester_code.js) that accurately replicates the gameplay example and verifies the test outcomes.
        A detailed report on the test results, indicating whether the game outcomes match the expectations and noting any discrepancies.
        A fully functional testing process that can be rerun to validate the gameâ€™s consistency with the predefined gameplay.
